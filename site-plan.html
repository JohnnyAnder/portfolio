        Welcome to a website all about Johnny! Here you will be able to see his Resume and some of his favorite things. I hope this will help you get to know him more and get a clearer picture of the kind of person he is.

        Background- My name is Johnathon Anderson but I go by Johnny. I was born and grew up about 40 minutes north of Cincinnati, Ohio in a place called Liberty Twp. I have been a member of the church of Jesus Christ of latter-day saints for my entire life. My dad became a member at 12 and my mom has also been a member her whole life. Iâ€™m the youngest of 7 children. I Graduated to Lakota west High School. I Started a 2 year mission in Johannesburg, South Africa, but due to Covid-19 I was sent home just after getting out of the Missionary Training Center there. I was sent back out shortly after to Farmington, New Mexico. I served for 6 weeks in the Navajo reservations before being sent home for personal reasons. For the next year I moved around from Provo, Utah to Downtown Cincinnati. I then applied to BYU-I and am attending here to this day. My major is Software Engineering.
